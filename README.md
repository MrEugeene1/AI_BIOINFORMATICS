# ðŸ§¬ AI in Bioinformatics: Lung Cancer Classification
This project explores the application of AI in Bioinformatics, specifically using gene expression data to classify lung cancer patients as tumor or normal cases. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we build a predictive model that enhances disease classification.

# ðŸš€ Key Features
* Data Preprocessing â€“ Merged multiple gene expression datasets, handled missing values, and standardized labels.
* Machine Learning Model â€“ Implemented logistic regression for classification.
* Train-Test Splitting â€“ Used stratified sampling to ensure balanced data distribution.
* Performance Evaluation â€“ Assessed accuracy with a confusion matrix and classification report.
* Visualization â€“ Generated insightful plots with Matplotlib & Seaborn.

# ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
* Python â€“ Core programming language
* Pandas & NumPy â€“ Data processing
* Scikit-learn â€“ Model training & evaluation
*Matplotlib & Seaborn â€“ Data visualization
